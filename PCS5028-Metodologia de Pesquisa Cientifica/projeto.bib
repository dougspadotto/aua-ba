abstract = {Globalisation, along with rapid demographic changes and evolving regulatory and legislative interventions, dictates the increasing demand for high quality, value-added and customised agrifood products. In this context, the design, development and operation of efficient agrifood supply chains (AFSCs) have begun to be met with increased interest in modern management science. Furthermore, the volatility of weather conditions, the perishability of goods, the complex food safety regulatory environment, the changing consumers' lifestyle trends, the environmental concerns and the plethora of stakeholders involved pose significant challenges towards the development of robust supply chains within the agrifood sector.In this manuscript, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical decision-making framework and a critical taxonomy that apply to all stakeholders involved in the design and management of AFSCs. More specifically, we first present the generic system components along with the unique characteristics of AFSCs that differentiate them from conventional supply chain networks. We then recognise the natural hierarchy of the decision-making process for the design and planning of AFSCs and provide a taxonomy of existing research efforts as these are mapped on the relevant strategic, tactical and operational levels of the hierarchical decision-making echelons. Our critical analysis demonstrates that the agrifood supply chain management is a rapidly evolving research field, focussing more on addressing case-dependent problems related with distinct supply chain echelons, and less on developing integrated methodological approaches for the optimisation of the entire supply chain. Our analysis further allows for the identification of gaps and overlaps in literature, as well as of future research areas. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAgrE.},

@article{Dabbene2014,
abstract = {In recent years, traceability aspects have become recognised as an essential tool for guaranteeing food safety and food quality. On the other hand, the design of a traceability system requires a thorough rethinking and reorganising of the whole food supply chain. This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on the aspects of supply chain management that are influenced by traceability, which is herein considered fully integrated in the chain management and not kept separately.The objective of the paper is twofold: the first goal is to analyse how traceability concepts, requirements and technologies influence modern supply chain management and are handled by the ensuing optimisation principles. This analysis is based on an in-depth scrutiny of the state of the art, and it is supported by precise pointers to the literature on the subject. The second goal is to highlight what could be, in the authors' opinion, the future trends and perspectives in this field of research. {\textcopyright} 2013 IAgrE.},

abstract = {Brazil is one of the largest producers of tropical fruit in the world, with a production of more than 31 million tones. However, in spite of its large capacity, Brazil runs a trade deficit in fresh fruit. First, this research identifies the factors relevant to the exportation of fruit in the areas of production, processing, distribution, commercialization and consumption with the objective of understanding better the supply chain management of fruit growing for the foreign market. Some of the factors which considered are the operational stages of the international supply chain of Brazilian mango (foreign trade and logistics), operational peculiarities, the safety and quality of the mango, the best practices of fruit suppliers of the international market and the factors limiting the export of Brazilian mango to the principal international markets. After identification and analysis of the relevant factors, the focus becomes specifically the mango chain and, based on strategy and supply chain management theory, a model is proposed to guide the choice of management strategy of the supply chain of Brazilian mango for the foreign market. The model which is proposed takes into account the competitive strategy of the firm and the supply chain strategy to obtain the best alignment of the two for serving coherently the expectations of the target-market.},
